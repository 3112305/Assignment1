Keys for rotation and substitution ciphers should be in the files rotCiphKey.txt and subCiphKey.txt

to cipher a message, put it in the rotationCipher.txt or the substitutionCipher.txt files then run 
through the program

to decipher put the encrypted text into rotationDecipher.txt or substitutionDecipher.txt and run through
the program

user interraction is recommended with the decipher because a human mind is much smarter at suggestion
than a dictionary check
